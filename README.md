Hi! I'm Magda and I've starded my andventure with programming at the beginning of the year. I've learned Java from scratch on my own. 
A month later, I became a participant in the Tech Leaders programme, during which I was building the backend of a web application. 
I used technologies such as SpringBoot, databases ex. PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, REST Api, Postman. I wrote the application in Java language.

I would love to continue learning programming, get to know new technologies and then have my first job as a programmer. 
I am convinced that at the Motorola programming academy I would gain a huge amount of knowledge,  would later be extremely useful in my job at your company.
